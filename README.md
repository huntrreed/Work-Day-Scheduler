# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description
It can be a full time job keeping track of all the meetings and appointments you have set throughout the work day. A simple solution to this is to have a web app that  you can enter tasks and meetings throughout the day to keep yourself on schedule. 

In this web app, you can see an outline of the work day from 9-5 with time blocks for each hour. For each time block you can click in the block to add an appointment, meeting, or task that you need to complete at a certian time. Since these events are stored to local storage, they will remain on your scheduler even if you click out of the app or close the page and pull it back up later. 

In order to help keep track of time throughout the day, there is also a built in feature that shows the hours that have already passed in grey, the current hour in red, and future hours of the day in green. Since it can be easy to get carried away in tasks, this feature will help keep you on track to complete everything you need to complete throughout the day!
